        <p class="centered-text">Hi, Iâ€™m  Karishma and I am currently studying to become a junior technical analyst at Nology.
                    Prior to this, I was studying Optometry at Cardiff University, however  I wanted to switch my career path to something much more creative that I knew I would enjoy. I quickly found myself looking towards a career in Technology!
